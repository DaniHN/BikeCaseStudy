The Excel Process - From Dirty to Clean:

- Download the most recent consecutive annual data here (which will be 12 files): https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
  
- Unzip all 12 files and place them in a specially named folder with CSV in the title for clarification.
  
- Place that folder in a location relevant to the material. The CSV files will be used for SQL.
  
- AFTER we clean the data, THEN we will copy and convert all the files to XLSX inside a new folder with XLSX in the title.

- I Recommend to the all the cleaning first on the XLSX files, and then after data is cleaned, saved a copy of it as a CSV.
 -> I realized that after saving a copy first of the CSV like the case study suggested.

 If the sheets have any missing data, remove the entire row 
- Cleaning the data
- Now the data is clean and consistent, it's time to add new columns by using formulas:
  
 Adding ride_length
 
 Adding day_of_week
 
 Combining all files into one sheet

The Excel Process - Time to Analyze:

 Run a few calculations
 
 Pivot tables and Graphs

- Calculate the average ride_length for members and casual riders
- Calculate the Max ride_length for members and casual riders
- Calculate the number of rides for users by day_of_week
- Calculate what type of bikes used for members and casual riders by month

Summary
There are some visual edits you can make. Those are at your discretion, of course.
Take your one year of data analysis sheets and merge the pivot tables and graphs into one new sheet.
Finally, take a screen shot of it,  Now your Excel summary visuals are complete!
